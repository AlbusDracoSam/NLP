  Bottom Top Approach Of Learning
  1. Text Preprocessing Level 1- Tokenization,Lemmatization,StopWords,POS
  2. Text Preprocessing Level 2- Bag Of  Words, TFIDF, Unigrams,Bigrams,n-grams
  3. Text Preprocessing- Gensim,Word2vec,AvgWord2vec
  4. Solve Machine Learning Usecases
  5. Get the Understanding Of Artificial Neural Network
  6. Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM,GRU
  7. Text Preprocessing Level 3- Word Embeddings, Word2vec
  8. Bidirectional LSTM RNN, Encoders And Decoders, Attention Models
  9. Transformers 
  10. BERT 
  
 ## Text Processing Level - 1 
 
 ### Tokenization
  Tokenization is the process of converting the whole data or a paragraph into sentences and words.
  
   Library used :
   
   NLTK 
   
   **Paragraph -> Sentences**
   
    sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize('paragraph')
    
   **Paragraph -> Words**
   
    words = nltk.word_tokenize('paragraph')
